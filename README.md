# Credit Risk Classification
### University of Minnesota Data Analytics Boot Camp Challenge 20


## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, I aimed to develop a predictive model that assesses the credit risk of borrowers using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending service. My goal was to build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This model would help the lending service identify high-risk borrowers and make more informed lending decisions, thereby managing credit risk effectively.

Results
Below is a summary of the logistic regression model's performance metrics:

Accuracy Score: The model achieved an accuracy score of [insert accuracy score], indicating the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes for both high-risk and healthy loans.
Precision Score: The precision for predicting high-risk loans was [insert precision score]. Precision measures how often the model correctly identified high-risk loans among all loans it labeled as high risk.
Recall Score: The recall score for high-risk loans was [insert recall score]. Recall indicates the modelâ€™s ability to capture actual high-risk loans from all loans that were high-risk.
Summary
The logistic regression model performed reasonably well, accurately identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers in the dataset. The model's precision and recall scores indicate a balanced performance, meaning it can help the lending service flag high-risk loans effectively while minimizing the misclassification of healthy loans as high risk. However, there may still be room for improvement in either precision or recall, depending on the company's specific needs.

In summary, I would recommend using this logistic regression model for credit risk assessment. It provides reliable predictions that can aid in identifying high-risk borrowers and managing lending risk more effectively. Further tuning or incorporating additional features could improve model performance, but this initial implementation serves as a strong foundation for the company's credit risk analysis.
